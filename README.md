<h1 align="center">Gson 2.0</h1>

<p align="center"><b>Ajusted by Pigerly. Orginally by <a href="https://google.com">Google</a> in the <a href="https://github.com/google">google</a>/<a href="https://github.com/google/gson">gson</a> GitHub library.</b></p>

Gson is a Java library that can be used to convert Java object into their JSON representation. It can also be used to convert a JSON string to an equivalent Java object. Gson can work with arbitrary Java objects including pre-existing objects that you do not have source-code of.

There are a few open-source projects that can convert Java objects to JSON. However, most of them require that you place Java annotations in your classes; something that you can not do if you do not have access to the source-code. Most also do not fully support the use of Java Generics. Gson considers both of these as very important design goals.

### The Diffrences
This is not exactly the same as the original Gson from Google so we do recommend looking at our documentation for switching between the two.

* Gson2 from Pigerly is not built with Maven and uses standard Java instead unlike Google's Gson.
* The new package is `com.pigerly.gson2` instead of `com.google.gson`.

### Downloading

All of our code can be either downloaded from the releases section of our GitHub page, downloading it from our Caviel Code page or by directly compiling yourself, all of which are documented below but we recommend rebuilding it yourself for the latest minor changes possibly not shown elsewhere.

### Support

Please use the 'gson2' tag on StackOverflow or the Gson2 [discord server](\(coming soon\)) to discuss Gson or to post questions.
